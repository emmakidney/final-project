# Hearing Impairment

More than 5% of the population has a hearing impairment or suffers from hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization. Hypoacusia is classified into four levels based on the noise level of sounds a person can hear: mild hearing loss allows a person to hear sounds louder than 21 to 40 dB, moderate hearing loss allows them to hear sounds louder than 40 to 69 dB, severe hearing loss only allows them to hear sounds louder than 71 to 90 dB, and profound hearing loss or deafness prevents them from hearing sounds louder than 90 dB. People with mild to severe hearing loss are likely to be able to speak clearly and benefit from hearing aids. Lip reading and speech or sign language are used by those with profound or total hearing loss to communicate. Hearing loss can be classified into three types:
- prelocutive or prelingual hearing loss, which appears before the age of two,
- perilocutive hearing loss, which appears between the ages of two and four,
- postlocutive hearing loss, which appears later in life.

Speech and language development are hampered in both prelocutive and perilocutive hearing loss. Speech might suffer from phonetic or prosodic changes as a result of postlocutive hearing loss (Pascual, Ribera and T. Granollers, 2014).

The Deaf face numerous prejudices from society and are sometimes misunderstood, for example, as "deaf-mute." Furthermore, because many people are unable to communicate using Sign Language, the deaf population has societal issues. As a result, the Deaf may experience isolation, low self-esteem, and discrimination, which may stifle the growth and evolution of deaf communities. Deaf people have struggled long and hard for their language to be recognized. The acknowledgement of Sign Language must be attained, yet there is still much to be learned, taught, and revealed about this language (Cardoso et al., 2015).

The W3C identifies many difficulties that Deaf people may have when using the Internet, including a lack of alternative subtitles and audio, the use of unclear and complex language, and a lack of video material. The aforementioned obstacles highlight the significance of research in such disciplines to prioritize the needs of the Deaf and raise awareness of the deaf populations' information and communication access restrictions (Cardoso et al., 2015).

Because videos are widely used in many disciplines, including education, the economy, entertainment, commerce, and politics, they are one of the technological resources with the highest potential on the web. According to statistics, 78 per cent of internet users view online videos at least once a week. The National Association of the Deaf sued major universities such as Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2015 because of problems caused by a lack of accessibility to videos (Acosta et al., 2020).

Users and students with accommodations may not be able to view video content if web developers and educators do not create it with accessibility in mind. Captions or transcripts are required for deaf students and people with partial hearing loss to read content while watching a video. Those who are blind or have low vision require audio descriptions to supplement their visual representations. While captions, transcripts, and/or audio descriptions are required for students with certain sensory impairments, they are also beneficial to other users. Those whose first language is not the same as the language spoken in the video can benefit from captions to aid comprehension. Students with learning difficulties can read transcripts at their own pace, use rewind and fast-forward buttons to go over a concept again, and/or pause the video if they need to take a break. If other students need to watch films in a quiet location without disrupting others or in a loud environment and cannot hear the audio, they can turn the volume off and read captions. If no accommodation forms have been submitted, educators may conclude that no students require accommodations (McCarron, 2021).

Users who cannot see video or hear audio need alternative ways to access the information. According to WCAG 2.0 standards:
"Depending on the content of your media, it might need captions/subtitles (a text version of the audio that is shown synchronized in the media player), a transcript (a separate text version of the audio), audio description of visual information (usually an additional audio stream that describes important visual content), or other accessibility functionality/features (Web Accessibility Initiative, 2019)."

Faculty have two options in ensuring that everyone can access their videos: they can either caption them and/or provide transcripts of the content.
