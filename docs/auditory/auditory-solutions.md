# Solutions to consider for Hearing Impairments

## Captioning videos

Captions can be added to videos either manually or automatically. Several video conferencing applications generate captions after the video has been recorded. Setting the audio transcript option, for example, can automatically generate transcripts (in English only) if Zoom sessions are recorded to the Zoom Cloud. The transcript is a separate file that can be used to display closed captions in a video after it has been recorded. Microsoft Teams also generates VTT format transcripts for close captioning, but only if the video is recorded to Microsoft Stream's cloud storage. As a "preview feature," Microsoft Teams uses automated speech recognition (ASR) technology to generate live captions during meetings (not available to everyone). Meeting attendees can see live captions in up to six languages chosen by meeting organizers from a selection of more than 50. When a Microsoft Teams conference finishes, the caption data is permanently deleted, but transcripts can be downloaded. Google Meet also offers live captioning (in English only), however, the captions aren't recorded and don't display in the video (McCarron, 2021).

Using YouTube's auto-captioning feature, creators can easily produce subtitles and then change them as needed for accuracy. This option is compatible with Zoom recordings as well as most screen-capture videos. Viewers can choose from over a hundred different languages to watch captions (which Google Translate provides) by selecting settings, subtitles, and auto-translate, regardless of what language was used to make them. To close caption videos on YouTube automatically, first, post the video, then review and change the captions (McCarron, 2021).

## Providing transcripts

There are two sorts of transcripts: basic and descriptive. Basic transcripts contain only the speech and non-speech audio information from a video in text, whereas descriptive transcripts also provide visual information needed to understand the content. Deaf people and people who have trouble understanding auditory information can benefit from basic transcripts. Screen readers and Braille printers can assist deaf-blind people with descriptive transcripts. Download and edit YouTube caption text to add any relevant information such as "[birds chirping]" or "[mobile phone ringing]" to make transcripts for YouTube videos. After finishing captions on YouTube, save them in sub-viewer (.sbv) format, open them in a text editor, and make any necessary changes (McCarron, 2021).
