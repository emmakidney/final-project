# Solutions to consider for Cognitive Disabilities

The cognitive disability population's vast diversity requires a similarly complicated set of solutions, not only in terms of design and development but also in terms of content creation. While users with moderate cognitive disabilities can be accommodated by following WCAG guidelines, audiences with more severe manifestations are more likely to have restricted communication and IT capabilities, necessitating radical access and information solutions (Kennedy, 2012).

Because of the diversity of intellectual disabilities, different accessibility measures have different impacts on non-disabled web users. Some front-end measures may appear to be more aggressive than other 'behind the scenes' measures used to treat sensory or physical problems. Large fonts, simple language, and deep rather than wide structures, which are essential for cognitive accessibility, have a greater impact on a website's usability than producing code that can be read by a screen reader. Good mark-up for sensory/physical disabilities, on the other hand, will often result in other benefits such as better search engine optimization, faster downloads, or cross-platform compatibility, so accessibility for persons with sensory or physical disabilities has other benefits as well (Kennedy, 2012).

Another solution to consider would be to hold user-testing sessions on students when converting material and courses online. User-testing sessions are critical for increasing awareness and knowledge of intellectual accessibility, especially the challenges of designing for such a broad population. The rules pose a significant risk of creating a tick-box culture, in which web designers become more concerned with verifying code than with creating a truly accessible site (Kennedy, 2012).
