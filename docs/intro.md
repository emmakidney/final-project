# Intoduction

The World Wide Web serves as an essential platform for information transmission. Over the last few years, educational institutions such as universities are utilising the web to cater to their target audience. This became more evident during the Covid-19 pandemic, when almost all educational institutions went virtual where they could. With this major shift to virtual academic delivery, the needs of those students with disabilities grew and it became essential to improve the accessibility of online learning. 

It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities.  Access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (w3c_wai, 2019). Web Accessibility is a practice that allows the Web to be used by people with a wide range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability (w3c_wai, 2019). To guarantee the accessibility of websites, one must ensure that they are compatible with commonly used input and output tools (software and/or devices). This also includes Assistive Technologies which are created specifically for people with special needs, like blind, hard-of-hearing, or motor-impaired people (Access for all, 2018). There is also a vast [number of software](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/setup/helper-tools/)s that helps in developing accessible websites. 

This paper aims to explore how people with disabilities use the web, and how we can help improve their experience. Suggestions will be made as to how a web page or application can provide a more accessible learning experience to students. Web accessibility can help to reduce the digital divide, improve efficiency, improve response time, reduce development costs, maintain websites, and demonstrate social responsibility. (Acosta-Vargas, Luis Antonio Salvador-Ullauri and S. Luján-Mora, 2019)        

## Web Accessibility

In the post Covid-19 era, educational institutions all over the world have turned to the web as a means of communication. The official websites of educational institutions, such as universities, are increasingly the principal means of access. All vital information, such as admissions-related information, course materials distribution, and examination-related information, is made available to both present and prospective students via university websites (Kuppusamy and Balaji, 2021).

The World Health Organization has stated that 15% of the world population is experiencing some sort of disabilities, which scales up to 1 billion. In other words, one in seven persons in the global population has some sort of disabilities. This significant chunk of human population should not be left facing barriers in accessing critical information resources (Kuppusamy and Balaji, 2021). Web accessibility can help to reduce the digital divide, improve efficiency, improve response time, reduce development costs, maintain websites, and demonstrate social responsibility (Acosta-Vargas, Luis Antonio Salvador-Ullauri and S. Luján-Mora, 2019). An empathic approach should be taken by web developers when considering those with diverse abilities. 

WCAG 2.0 was developed to cover recommendations that make web content more accessible, taking into account various web technologies. It comprises 12 guidelines related to four main web accessibility principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Each guideline comprises various success criteria or SCs (A. Alsaeedi, 2020).

The recommendations serve as a foundation for developers and web-masters that want to make material more accessible to disabled people. It is critical to follow these standards so that elderly and disabled users can access content without difficulty. However, determining whether or not the contents correspond with the requirements is difficult to assess and test. As a result, it was suggested that SC be tested manually or automatically with web accessibility checkers. The minimal level of compliance (designated by A) covers 25 SC, the intermediate level of conformance (designated by AA) covers 13 SC as well as all the criteria in level A, and the greatest level of conformance (designated by AAA) covers all the criteria in level AA and 23 additional SC. In other words, each SC is assigned to a compliance level. If a web-page fulfils all of the SC in that level and the previous level, it is considered to meet that level of conformance.(A. Alsaeedi, 2020).

There are several disabilities that can affect access to the web. These disabilities can be broken down into four categories: visual, cognitive, auditory, physical. Each of these categories will be explored in the following sections, as well as their impact on academic delivery and virtual learning.
