# Solutions to consider for Visual Impairment

## Reduce Clutter

When visually impaired people use the Internet, they have to sift through a lot of useless information or clutter. Most web pages, for example, have banners, advertising, navigation bars, and other types of distracting material that is unrelated to the information that users are looking for. Making non-visual web browsing usable requires being able to swiftly navigate to the appropriate content. Screen readers allow for keyword searching to find information rapidly. This assumes that people know exactly what they're looking for, which isn't always the case, particularly with ad-hoc surfing (Ramakrishnan, Ashok and Billah, 2017).

Skimming and summarizing are two complementary approaches for getting the gist of a text document. Summarization is a snippet of text that represents the essence of the information contained in a document and is generated explicitly from the document's language. Skimming conveys it by identifying a few informative words in the document. Summarization and skimming are reasonable applications for web pages, particularly for non-visual browsing, because they allow users to get a "taste" of the material without having to listen to it in its entirety (Ramakrishnan, Ashok and Billah, 2017).

The following is an example of a non-visual skimming method: To begin, each sentence is analysed to determine grammatical relationships between words. Second, a vocabulary tree is built based on these relationships, with each branch representing a word in the phrase. Finally, grammatical and structural features are retrieved for each word in this tree. These characteristics are fed into a trained classifier, which determines whether or not the word should be included in the skimming summary. Finally, a sub-tree made up of the chosen words is created. The skimming summary that users interact with via an interface is represented by this sub-tree (Ramakrishnan, Ashok and Billah, 2017).

## Semantic Awareness

The basis of the usability issues is a screen reader's lack of understanding of the semantics of web material. Accessibility research has attempted to address this issue by combining semantic awareness with non-visual surfing. At their foundation, semantic awareness approaches determine semantics by analysing content utilizing syntactic and structural clues in web pages, which can be complemented with an explicit knowledge base recording the semantics of domain-specific websites like travel sites, retail sites, and so on. Beyond online accessibility, semantic awareness is important (Ramakrishnan, Ashok and Billah, 2017).

## PDF Accessibility

A major component of online learning is the sharing of information or course material using PDF files. When used correctly, this method is barrier-free for students using screen readers. However, unawareness of users with disabilities can lead to ignorant decisions, such as scanning in a physical resource as opposed to typing it up. This results in its content being a PDF image document. Because the content is only coded as a visual, it does not allow for document searches or text extraction. In terms of accessibility, a PDF image document is comparable to a paper document. It must be changed for blind users using an optical character recognition technology to encode the text, adapt it to screen readers, or change the display (Turr√≥, 2008).
