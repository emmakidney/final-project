# Solutions to consider for Colour Blindness

## Monochromatic Colour Scheme

Monochromacy should not be confused with monochromatic colour schemes. Monochromacy is a rare kind of colour blindness in which the person can only perceive one colour in different shades. Monochrome is designed and used in such a manner, with designs made completely of a single colour in many shades rather than using several colours. Using a monochromatic colour palette isn't always a bad thing. In reality, achieving unity within our design can be a huge benefit. Although we may classify black as a second colour, we can generate equal contrast by just selecting an extremely dark form of our selected colour. When choosing a monochromatic colour scheme, creating contrast is a simplicity. Colour-blind people can still perceive different shades of colour, therefore introducing contrast isn't a problem since it's seen in the same way. Any single colour can be utilized in a monochromatic colour scheme, and it can be quite effective. However, for those who automatically thought "black and white" when we said monochromatic, that works as well also. Many minimalist websites employ a grayscale colour scheme, which should be easy to view in an intended way for everybody. Grayscale can look great if we want to be safe, as long as it fits with the overall tone and mood of our design (Abd Ellfattah and Tawfik, 2014).

## Contrast

High contrast is vital since it helps to create a uniform colour palette. It's possible to make very light to very dark shades of a single colour, providing you with a wide range of values to work with. For instance, if a bright blue was used as a background, a considerably darker blue would be essential for the text to be legible. The use of monochrome allows colour blind users to appreciate the layout even if they are unable to recognize the intended hues. High contrast, on the other hand, improves readability for all users and is a design guideline we should be aware of even if we aren't concerned with accessibility (Abd Ellfattah and Tawfik, 2014).

## Using Existing Colour Schemes

Colours can be "borrowed" from other web designs or non-web-based designs. We may readily discover colours within a design and start employing them on our own by simply taking out the eyedropper tool from graphic editing tools. Borrowing colour schemes can be a great approach to figure out what works well and then replicate it in a new way while keeping the effective intentions of the original scheme. Designers can utilize it in conjunction with other approaches once they have recognized colours and converted them to hex values (Abd Ellfattah and Tawfik, 2014).

## Avoid Colour Coding

Accessible maps and infographics can be significantly more difficult to create. It is not advisable to rely solely on colour coding. A combination of colour and texture or pattern can be used, along with precise labels, and reflect this in a key or legend. Combining a blue background with a cross-hatched pattern, or a pink background with a stippled dot, the users will always have two pieces of information to work with (Abd Ellfattah and Tawfik, 2014).
