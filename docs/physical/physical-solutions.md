# Solutions to consider for Physical Impairments

## Keyboard alternatives for all mouse functionalities

When using only a keyboard, certain navigation paths or reactive designs triggered by the user's mouse may be inaccessible. When browsing a website from a range of devices, providing keyboard alternatives can be beneficial. Tabbing across the web page with the keyboard can be used to measure usability. This method can assist users who do not have access to a pointing device in navigating a web page. The ability to use the keyboard to accomplish all of the functions on the web page makes it more compatible with voice input technology. When speech recognition is used on a keyboard, it can be a lot easier. This is because utilizing voice instructions to control the keyboard is considerably easier than using the mouse when communicating with the computer (Abu Doush, 2022).

## Ensuring font size can be increased

The option to increase the font size of the web page must be available to the user. This will aid those with motor disabilities who are unable to accurately locate links due to motor control issues. They would be able to discover the elements on the web page more easily if the font size can be increased (Abu Doush, 2022).

## Skip to main contents link

The several tabs required to begin a task on a web page are one of the most significant accessibility issues. The web developer should include a skip to the main contents link at the top of the page. This can assist people with motor difficulties who use the keyboard to navigate by jumping to the main contents rather than tabbing for a long period to get to the required content.

When using the keyboard to surf the web, users will notice that the important content is not always the first thing on the page. Before reaching the primary content, the user will be required to tab through a large list of navigation links, sub-lists of links, site searches, and other features using the keyboard.

The skip navigation link can be embedded in the regular text at the top of the page by the site developer. Then, at the start of the main content, add a hyperlink to the relevant link destination, linking the first item the user sees. This is critical because the user would otherwise be unaware of the link's availability( Abu Doush, 2022).

## Large click-able elements

The web developer must make sure that links and image links are large enough and that there is sufficient space between them. This can assist those with motor difficulties who are unable to control the mouse accurately enough to pick the required link. A physically impaired user will have difficulty locating a small click-able element on a webpage using the mouse because it necessitates precise mouse movement (Abu Doush, 2022).

## Confirmation of information before submission

People with motor disabilities who have trouble operating the mouse find it difficult to locate moving targets on a web page since they can't move the pointing device easily (Abu Doush, 2022).
