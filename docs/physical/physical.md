# Physical

Weakness and limitations of muscular control (such as involuntary movements such as tremors, lack of coordination, or paralysis), limitations of sensation, joint disorders (such as arthritis), pain that impedes movement, and missing limbs are all examples of physical disabilities (also known as "motor disabilities"). To use the Web, people with physical disabilities often use specialized hardware and software such as:
- Ergonomic or specially designed keyboard or mouse,
- Head pointer, mouth stick, and other aids to help with typing,
- On-screen keyboard with trackball, joysticks, or other pointing devices,
- Switches operated by foot, shoulder, sip-and-puff, or other movements,
- Voice recognition, eye tracking, and other approaches for hands-free interaction.

To use the computer, people with physical impairments may want to use a mouse or a mouse-like device, or a keyboard or a keyboard-like device. People with physical impairments rely on keyboard help to access web page functionality. They may require more time to type, mouse, or engage in other interactions, and they may activate commands by typing single keystrokes in sequence rather than typing simultaneous keystrokes ("chording"). Commands for special characters, short-cut keys, and active menu items are examples of such keystrokes (WAI, 2022).

Difficulties physically impaired users face include:
The user is unable to use the mouse: the web developer must give a keyboard option for all mouse events on the page. A sub-menu that appears only when the mouse cursor is over a certain image or link, or that displays information about a link when the mouse pointer is over that link, are examples of this.

Because the user's mouse and keyboard cannot be controlled precisely, the web developer must avoid adding small links, moving links, or time-sensitive content. It is necessary to assist the user when they take an action inadvertently by allowing them to undo that action. (For example, ask the user if they are sure they want to submit the completed form.)
The user can only control the mouse or keyboard using voice commands: the web developer must provide a keyboard alternative for every mouse event for the user to execute various tasks using voice commands. The fundamental issue with utilizing speech recognition is that it requires a clear voice from the user, and developments in voice recognition technology are not uniform across all natural languages.
Because some adaptive technologies, such as sip-and-puff or mouth-stick, are used for long periods, the user may feel fatigued. This requires the web developer to provide the user with the ability to quickly skip lists or links on a long web page (Abu Doush, 2022).
