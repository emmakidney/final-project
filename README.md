The Web is designed to work for all people, regardless of hardware, software, language, location, or ability. It is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities.  Access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (w3c_wai, 2019).



 Web Accessibility is a practice that allows the Web to be used by people with a wide range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability (w3c_wai, 2019). To guarantee the accessibility of websites, one must ensure that they are compatible with commonly used input and output tools (software and/or devices). This also includes Assistive Technologies which are created specifically for people with special needs, like blind, hard-of-hearing, or motor-impaired people (Access for all, 2018). There is also a vast [number of software](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/setup/helper-tools/)s that helps in developing accessible websites.



##### Deployment:

This project is was built using Docusauras and is currently deployed using Netlify. You can find the project here: https://WAforD.netlify.app/



##### Key Goals:

- Create a handbook to include:

- - Current legislation around web accessibility
  - Differences to consider  for websites, software and mobile applications.
  - Tools and frameworks that  can aid a developer.
  - A series of test suites.
